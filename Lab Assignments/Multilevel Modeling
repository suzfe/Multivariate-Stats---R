#MLM Lab Assignment
# March 17, 2016

# import data
install.packages('foreign')
library('foreign')
question1<-read.spss(file.choose(), use.value.labels=TRUE, to.data.frame=TRUE) 
# or setwd() and then read.xls("") [if data is in excel file]

# attach data
attach(question1)

## Preparing Data
# Step 1: Inspect data for plausibility
range(question1$Ther_ID)
hist(question1$Ther_ID)

range(question1$Stressors)
hist(question1$Stressors)

range(question1$Anxiety)
hist(question1$Anxiety)

range(question1$Yrs_Experience)
hist(question1$Yrs_Experience)

## Step 2: Run the Analysis
# a) First analysis: The null model to calculate ICC
# used to determine if MLM is necessary

Null_model <- lme(fixed=Anxiety~1, random=~1|Ther_ID)
summary(Null_model)

ICC <- (3.867713^2)/((3.867713^2)+(3.821731^2))
ICC #0.506 is greater than 0.1, so MLM is needed 

# b) Second analysis: the random intercepts model 
randint <- lme(Anxiety ~ Stressors*Yrs_Experience, random=~1|Ther_ID)
summary(randint)

# c) Third analysis: random intercepts and slopes model
randintslope <- lme(Anxiety~ Stressors*Yrs_Experience, random= ~1+ Stressors|Ther_ID)
summary(randintslope)

#the random slopes doesn't make sense here 
# the random intercept model is the preferred model 
# I tried a random slopes model and didn't get a solution
# the relationship between stressors and anxiety will not be influenced by the therapist because we don't expect the relationship to change

# For Semi-Partial R:

Anova(randint, type=3)
